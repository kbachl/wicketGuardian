wicketGuardian - incorporate wicket and security solutions

Aims to incorporate wicket and security solutions to easily sit on top -
starting with Apache Shiro as first supported solution.

Based upon the work of Brian Topping, Tauren Mills (wicketstuff shiro)
and Matt Brictson (simple shiro-wicket).

Please note that for usage you need to provide the shiro-core at runtime
in your environment. Reason is to easily swap an insecure/ broken Apache
Shiro version to a fixed one without depending on this project to fix
the final import yourself.

wicketGuardian currently should work with Apache Shiro 1.0.0,
1.1.0 and 1.1.1 (later is targeted in its pom and works 100%);
wicket version is defined at 1.4.14 (maybe pluggable later?)
